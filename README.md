# Customer Segmentation

## Goals

The goals are: 

1. interpret the clustering results
2. name clusters by meaningful names
3. suggest actions **per each** cluster

Kindly note,  you are free to do any changes you'd like to on `jupyter notebook` file

## Steps

The steps to complete the task:

1. Set up virtualenv in order to install the `requirements.txt`
2. go over the feature descriptions 
3. go over the code, make sure you understand everything: don't ask questions without reading everything.
4. decide whether you need to add more features or not. Justify your choice
5. Interpret `summary statistics` table or any new object you'd like to add
6. Name the clusters!
7. Submit Jupyter Notebook file via email (khovhannisyan@aua.am)
